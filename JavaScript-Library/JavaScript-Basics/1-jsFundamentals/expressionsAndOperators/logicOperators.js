//Addition Operator
//add the previous value by one 
let x = 1;
let y = 1;

//x= x + 1;
//y += 1
//these will do the same


//Subtraction Operator

//x = x-1;
//y-= 1;


//Multiplication Operator
//x = x * 2 ;
//y *= 2
//console.log(x,y)

//Remainder (Modulus) Operator
//x = x % 1;
//y %=1;
//console.log(x,y)

//Exponential Operator
x = x ** 100;
y**=100
console.log(x,y);
